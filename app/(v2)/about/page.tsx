          Rayhan is an aspiring AI and Data Engineer currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Data Science at BINUS University.

        <p className="min-w-full mt-6">
          His passion for AI stems from the challenge of transforming raw data into meaningful insights and building systems that can learn, adapt, and scale. Reflecting this, his skillset blends strong foundations (Python, SQL, Cloud, Full-Stack Development) with exploratory interests (Deep Learning, NLP, and scalable data pipelines).

          Outside academics, he is a web developer experimenting with modern frameworks, a tinkerer who enjoys creating small apps to solve everyday problems, and a lifelong learner constantly exploring new tools and technologies. On quieter days, he dives into anime, experiments with new tools, or learns something new in programming and design.
